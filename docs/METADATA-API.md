# Metadata API

`qualflare` is the author-facing runtime API — the thing Mocha's own JSON output has no equivalent
of, and the main reason this package exists rather than parsing that file.

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'mocha';
import { qualflare } from '@qualflare/mocha';
```

Every call attaches to the **currently running test**, wherever it is made: the test body, a
`beforeEach`, or a helper several frames deep. Calling one outside a running test (at module load,
from `globalSetup`, or after a test has finished) logs a warning and is ignored — a metadata call
must never fail somebody's suite.

## How it works

Under `mocha --parallel`, tests run in **worker processes** while the reporter runs in the **main**
process, with no per-test channel between them — no equivalent of Vitest's `task.meta`. Worse, a Test
crosses that boundary through a **closed serialization allowlist**, so a property you set on the test
object is simply absent on the other side. That is measured, not assumed: a custom property read back
as its value in serial and `undefined` in parallel.

So this package bridges the gap itself: each `qualflare.*()` call is appended to a small newline-delimited file
in a private temp directory, and the reporter reads them back when the run ends. The directory is
created by the reporter before the run starts and handed to workers through an environment variable
they inherit at fork time, so there is nothing to configure and nothing predictable to collide with.

The same path is used in serial mode. There is no in-memory shortcut, because one code path is what
makes the serial/parallel parity test meaningful.

Three consequences worth knowing:

- Anything you pass must survive JSON — the channel crosses a process boundary, so unserialisable
  values are lost rather than rejected.
- A call made **outside a running test** (`beforeAll`, `afterAll`, module scope) has no test to
  attach to. It is dropped with a warning rather than attributed to whichever test reports first.
- A masked parameter is redacted **before** anything is written, so the real value never reaches the
  temp file, the report, or the server.

Every call is fail-open: a metadata problem never fails your test run.

## `qualflare.label(name, value)`

Arbitrary name/value metadata. This is how Allure-style `epic`/`feature`/`story`/`owner`/`severity`
are expressed.

```ts
qualflare.label('epic', 'Billing');
qualflare.label('owner', 'payments-team');
```

Capped at 100 labels per case (the server's limit); further labels are dropped.

**Requires `@qualflare/cli >= v0.1.18`.** Earlier CLI versions parsed the report but silently
discarded `labels` and `links`, so they never reached the server.

## `qualflare.link(url, opts?)`

A typed external reference.

```ts
qualflare.link('https://tracker.example/QF-42', { type: 'issue', name: 'QF-42' });
qualflare.link('https://wiki.example/runbook');            // type defaults to 'custom'
```

`opts.type` is `'issue' | 'tms' | 'custom'`. Capped at 20 links per case.

## `qualflare.tag(...tags)`

```ts
qualflare.tag('smoke');
qualflare.tag('billing', 'regression');
```

Merged with Mocha's own `TestCase.tags`. Use this for tags computed at runtime; declare static ones
in the test signature. Capped at 64 tags per case, each truncated to 255 characters.

## `qualflare.description(text)`

```ts
qualflare.description('Signs a user in and asserts the greeting renders.');
```

Markdown. Last call wins within a test.

## `qualflare.priority(value)`

```ts
qualflare.priority('high');
```

One of `'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical'`. Last call wins.

## `qualflare.parameter(name, value?, opts?)`

Records a named input.

```ts
qualflare.parameter('sku', 'BOOK-1');
qualflare.parameter('password', secret, { masked: true });
```

**Placement matters.** Inside an open `qualflare.step()`, the parameter attaches to that step.
Outside any step it becomes a `Case.properties` entry instead, because the wire contract has no
case-level `Parameter[]`.

`masked` **redacts the value before the report is written.** The secret never leaves this process:
it is not stored server-side and cannot be read back through the API. Inside a step the parameter
travels as `{ name, masked: true }` with no value and the UI renders `••••••` from the flag; outside
one it lands in `Case.properties`, a flat map with nowhere for the flag, so the value itself becomes
`••••••`.

A masked value is therefore **unrecoverable** — that is the point, but it is not a display toggle you
can undo later.

Requires v0.3.0 or newer of this package. Before that, `masked` was a display hint only: the real value
was sent, stored in plaintext and readable through the API, while only the UI drew dots over it.

## `qualflare.attachment(name, content, opts?)`

Attach in-memory content.

```ts
qualflare.attachment('request', JSON.stringify(body), { mimeType: 'application/json' });
qualflare.attachment('thumbnail', pngBase64, { encoding: 'base64', mimeType: 'image/png' });
```

`opts.encoding` is `'utf8'` (default) or `'base64'`. Subject to the same size caps as any other
inline attachment — see [`CONFIGURATION.md`](./CONFIGURATION.md).

## `qualflare.attachmentFromFile(name, path, opts?)`

Attach a file from disk, read at report time.

```ts
qualflare.attachmentFromFile('har', 'artifacts/session.har', { mimeType: 'application/json' });
```

An unreadable path is skipped with a warning rather than failing the test.

## `qualflare.step(name, fn)`

Records a named step around `fn`, capturing its duration and whether it threw.

```ts
await qualflare.step('add an item to the cart', async () => {
  qualflare.parameter('sku', 'BOOK-1');
  expect(cart.items).toHaveLength(1);
});
```

Always `await` it — it returns a promise resolving to whatever `fn` returns, and a rejection is
re-thrown after the failure is recorded, so control flow is unchanged.

**Mocha has no `test.step()`**, so this is the only way to get step structure into a report — and
the step exists in Qualflare only, not in Mocha's terminal or HTML output. The sibling Playwright
package does delegate to a native step API, so its steps appear in both.

Timing is exact: real elapsed time around the awaited body, not an approximation.

Steps nest, and nesting is preserved in the report via `parentIndex`. A single test may record at
most 300 steps; past that they are dropped with a warning rather than risking the server rejecting
the whole case.

## Mocha has no native attachment API

Playwright, Cypress and CucumberJS each capture something automatically — screenshots, videos, or
`this.attach()` calls. Mocha has no equivalent: it produces no artifacts of its own, so
`qualflare.attachment()` and `qualflare.attachmentFromFile()` are the only way to attach anything.

Images (`image/png`, `image/jpeg`, `image/gif`) are written into `outputDir` and referenced by
`localImagePath`, so they never travel base64-inlined inside the upload body. Everything else is
inlined, bounded by `maxAttachmentBytes` and the run-wide budget.
