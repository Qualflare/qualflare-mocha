 * Vitest's `task.meta`, which is serialized from worker to reporter for free.
 * Nor are we taking over `testEnvironment`: that slot is frequently already
 * occupied by a user's own environment, which is why Allure's Jest integration
 * has to ship separate `/node` and `/jsdom` builds.
 *
 * So the in-worker runtime appends NDJSON here and the reporter drains it. The
 * directory is suffixed with the MAIN process's pid, which both sides can
 * derive without configuration: the reporter is in that process, and a worker
 * reaches it through `process.ppid`. Two concurrent Jest runs on one machine
 * therefore cannot collide.
 *
 * Under `--runInBand` there are no workers at all, so nothing is written — see
 * `runtime/channel.ts`, which switches to an in-memory store. */
